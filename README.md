# Hello 👋

I'm MrBoombastic - T H E&nbsp;&nbsp;G R E A T&nbsp;&nbsp;D E V E L O P E R

People say I'm funny, intelligent and sensible, but they're wrong.
Anyway, click on the link to my personal website to contact me; it should be somewhere around here.

# My interests:

- 😿 JavaScript/Node.JS
- 💖 Go
- ☁️ Cloud in general - managing instances, networks, policies. Azure and GCP are cool.
- 🔩 Metal - dedicated servers are OK too. Look, there is a bolt emoji, so it must be about hardware. You know, bare
  metal, nuts, and bolts. DID YOU SEE WHAT I DID THERE?
- 🥕 RaspberryPI
- 💾 Computers on the hardware side. Processors, graphics cards, and releases that only happen on paper.
- 🥚 Shortwave radio
- 🎹 Music — especially from the 70s to the 90s. I like everything from classic electronic music by Jean-Michel Jarre and
  Kraftwerk, by early techno music, to Depeche Mode and Pink Floyd. Today's music is mostly crap to me.

# My projects:

Look at the pinned repos. Half of them are interesting, and half of that half are working! 🫨

# Currently working on:

- [BOOMfinity](https://boomfinity.xyz) - funny Discord bot with some nice add-ons
- [NaProdukcji](https://naprodukcji.xyz) - my blog about technology and security
- [ZaufanaTrzeciaStrona](https://zaufanatrzeciastrona.pl/) - research and development, being a janitor

# Quick Q&A, but without the Q:

- I've stolen my nickname from a Shaggy song.
- And yes, I've stolen my avatar from my own bot too.
- \***** ***
- JavaScript sucks sometimes, but it's like masochism - I can ~~happily~~ live with it. Well, except maybe for the lack
  of
  multithreading. And common sense.
- PHP should die along with Flash and Silverlight. Actually, JS can join them too.
- I wish I could write beautiful frontend. I mean, I can, but only ugly. I'm a bad UX designer.

# Image fillers, so you can have finally something to look at:

- Public repositories only:

- My biggest project - BOOMfinity (you can click on it 😮):
  [![BOOMfinity](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/450017151323996173/9255dd75f4dcfe2c7ca17393a7dcdebf.png?size=4096)](https://boomfinity.xyz)
- I've run out of ideas for pictures.

# My list of hated things:

- PHP
- Python
- TikTok
- Fortnite
- Google's policy of killing random service every 3 months
- Apple —it just doesn't work
- Polish variable names in code

This whole repo is a cringe, actually. Read [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) for cure, even if you aren't Polish.
